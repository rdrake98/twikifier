# What

This is a first pass at creating node.js-based wikifier for wikitext
formatted as TiddlyWiki text.

Rather than creating new code this code simply assembles the required
parts from the TiddlyWiki
[core code repository](http://svn.tiddlywiki.org/Trunk/core/js/) along
with the necessary bits of additional JavaScript. This means that as
the TiddlyWiki core changes this code automatically keeps up to date.

By using jsdom and htmlparser with node, it is possible to simulate the
browser environment that the wikifier would normally run in, and create
some HTML output.

# How

(The below is for OS X but should transliterate to other environments.  It has also been tested on Ubuntu 12.04)

Install node.js and its package manager npm. If you are using brew that
goes like this:

    brew install node npm

One you have npm, install jsdom, htmlparser, jQuery (case sensitive), tav, location, navigator and xmlhttprequest

    npm install net url jsdom@0.2.15 htmlparser jQuery tav location navigator xmlhttprequest

If you want to use server.js you also need:

    npm install memcached@0.0.10 hashlib node-uuid

hashlib may fail to install on your machine.  If this is the case then manually install it via [this link](https://github.com/brainfucker/hashlib#install).

Node modules can cause headaches when runtime problems are encountered.  Below is a dependency tree that is proven to work:

    ├── htmlparser@1.7.6
    ├── jQuery@1.7.4
    ├─┬ jsdom@0.2.15
    │ ├─┬ contextify@0.1.3
    │ │ └── bindings@1.0.0
    │ ├── cssom@0.2.5
    │ └─┬ request@2.11.4
    │   ├─┬ form-data@0.0.3
    │   │ ├── async@0.1.9
    │   │ └─┬ combined-stream@0.0.3
    │   │   └── delayed-stream@0.0.5
    │   └── mime@1.2.7
    ├── location@0.0.1
    ├─┬ memcached@0.0.10
    │ └─┬ hashring@0.0.6
    │   └── bisection@0.0.2
    ├── navigator@1.0.1
    ├── net@1.0.0
    ├── node-uuid@1.3.3
    ├── tav@0.1.0
    ├─┬ url@0.7.9
    │ ├── punycode@1.0.0
    │ └── querystring@0.1.0
    └── xmlhttprequest@1.4.2

Make sure you set `NODE_PATH`:

    export NODE_PATH=/usr/local/lib/node

In the repo directory run:

    make test

This will get all the necessary TiddlyWiki code and concatenate it into
`twikifier.js` and then run that file as a node script. The `test` target
runs all the files in the test directory against twikifier.

You can try your own wikitext by piping data into twikify on STDIN:

    ./twikify --collection=<url for tiddler collection> < /tmp/mysampledata.txt

or by giving the names of multiple files on the command line:

    ./twikify --collection=<url for tiddler collection> /tmp/mysampledata.txt \
        /tmp/someotherdata.txt

`<url for tiddler collection>` should be replaced with the url of a collection
of tiddlers, in JSON, as found in TiddlyWeb. Things like:

    http://cdent-test7.tiddlyspace.com/bags/cdent-test7_public/tiddlers
    http://cdent-test7.tiddlyspace.com/recipes/cdent-test7_public/tiddlers

As the tool develops there will be other interfaces.

# Use with TiddlyWeb and Tiddlyspace

Copy twikified.py into the folder where the instance is running.

Add 'twikified' to the list of system plugins in tiddlywebconfig.py.

Run the twikifier server:

    ./twikifier_server

Or:

    node server.js

Then start TiddlyWeb/Tiddlyspace

If you have connection problems after a restart, remove `/tmp/wst.sock` and try again.

# Why

TiddlyWeb and friends use [WikklyText](http://wikklytext.com/) to do sever-side
rendering of TiddlyWiki text to HTML. It works, but not great. It has long been
thought that a transcoding of the TiddlyWiki wikifier would a) work better,
b) be easier to extend and modify.

Also see the next section.

# Comments

In order to get the TiddlyWiki wikifier to work standalone, a great deal
of the TiddlyWiki code is required. Have a look at `TWREMOTES` in the
`Makefile` and the comments in `TwikifierBase.js`. The general overview
comment is that TiddlyWiki is non-functional: meaning its modules and methods
are tightly coupled with others, have many side effects and make use of 
data from globals rather than passed in parameters. This means that independent
code reuse is nigh on impossible.

That this is true is neither surprising, nor damning: TiddlyWiki was originally
built as a single file application. However since there is code in
there that could be useful if extracted and abstracted, hopefully this work
can point out some of the problems.

I tried to write down a simple dependency tree that explains how each
chunk of javascript requires another, but delineating the reasons got to be
too much so instead: What follows has less explanation than it could.

`twikifier` functionality currently lives in `twikify` and `TwikifierBase.js`.

`twikify` requires global `wikify()` in `Wikifier.js`.

`Wikifier.js` requires the global `formatter`, a `Formatter` from `FormatterHelpers.js`.

`FormatterHelpers.js` requires the global `config`, from `Config.js`.

A `Formatter` needs formatters, which are in `config` and defined in `Formatter.js`.

`Formatter.js` requires `FormatterHelper.js`, creating a cycle.

`Wikifier.js` requires global `createTiddlyText()`, from `Utilities.js`.

`Wikifier.js` requires global `createTiddlyElement()`, from `Utilities.js`.

`Formatter.js`, to format links, requires global `createTiddlyLink()` from `Utilities.js`.

`Utilities.js` requires the `pushUnique` modification to the `Array` prototype. This is found in `BasicTypes.js`.

`Formatter.js`, `FormatterHelpers.js`, `Utilities.js` all make use of a `store` global. A store, is a `TiddlyWiki` class, from `TiddlyWiki.js`.

`TiddlyWiki.js` calls `instanceof Tiddler` (4 times) and `new Tiddler` (twice), thus requiring `Tiddler.js`.

`Utilities.js` has `getTiddlyLinkInfo`, which requires `Lingo.js` for messages.
(`Lingo.js` requires `Config.js` and `Utilities.js` (for merge()).)

Presenting messages requires adding `format()` to the `String` prototype, thus requiring `Strings.js`.

This gets us to a working formatter, but not macros.

Adding `Macros.js` adds (limited, not yet tested) support for macros. `Macros.js` requires `Config.js`.

For macros to run, we need `invokeMacro`, which is from main.js. Rather
than including main.js (which has active code at the global level) I
made a copy of `invokeMacro`. It is not clear why the function definition
code is in main.

The difficulty here is not so much that there are a bunch of interdependencies,
but rather that the interdependencies are in the global scope and because
the files are simply building blocks for a single file, there are no clues
like import statements, namespaces, etc.

# Next

While the existing code will do basic rendering, to be truly useful
in a [TiddlyWeb](http://tiddlyweb.com/) situation, twikifier
needs two things:

* To present a web service or local socket that takes an input (a text
  string, a tiddler bag/title combo?) and returns the generated HTML.

Packaging this up as a node module would also be of use.
